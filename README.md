# MUST DO PATTERN PROBLEMS BEFORE STARTING DSA

This repository contains all the important any aspiring Software Engineer should solve before starting a DSA journey. It's a part of the [Striverâ€™s A2Z DSA Course/Sheet](https://takeuforward.org/?s=Striver%27s+A2Z+DSA+Course). Check the link to dive deep into the fundamentals of DSA.

The patterns are all about nested loops, the code is written with Python and can be easily adapt to any other coding language. The main goal is to focus on problem solving and the general process to come up with the solution. 

The Time Complexity is `O(n ^ 2)` for all the patterns.

The Space Complexity is `O(1)`.

### Below is the general process to write the pseudocode.

1. For the outer loop, count the number of lines.

2. For the inner loop, focus on the columns, and connect them somehow to the rows.

3. Print the character inside the inner loop

4. Observe symmetry (optional)
